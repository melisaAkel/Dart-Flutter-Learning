# Dart Programming Course Repository by Melisa Ä°rem Akel

This repository contains 13 comprehensive lectures designed to help you learn Dart, a powerful and versatile programming language developed by Google. The course is suitable for beginners as well as experienced developers looking to expand their skillset.

Throughout the course, you will gain hands-on experience with Dart through various coding examples, exercises, and projects. By the end of the course, you will have a strong foundation in Dart programming and be ready to develop your own applications or contribute to existing projects.

## Prerequisites

## Lecture 1: Introduction to Dart Programming
In this lecture, we will cover the basics of Dart programming, including variable declaration, data types, and basic control structures.

### Topics covered:

- Variables and data types
- Basic control structures
- Functions
- The dart:io library

## Lecture 2: Collections, Lists, and Maps
In this lecture, we will explore Dart's collection types, including Lists, Sets, and Maps. We will also discuss common operations and methods associated with these data structures.

### Topics covered:

- Lists
- Maps
- Loops and iterations
- Functions

## Lecture 3: Classes, Objects, and Null Safety
In this lecture, we will discuss object-oriented programming in Dart, including classes, objects, constructors, and null safety. We will also cover importing Dart files and using external classes.

### Topics covered:

- Null safety and nullable types
- Classes and objects
- Constructors and optional parameters
- Importing Dart files

## Lecture 4: Extends and Abstract Classes, Implements, and Enum
In this lecture, we will explore inheritance, abstract classes, interfaces, and enums in Dart. These concepts are essential for creating organized and reusable code.

### Topics covered:

- Abstract classes
- Inheritance and the extends keyword
- Interfaces and the implements keyword
- Enums and their usage

## Lecture 5: Extension Methods
In this lecture, we will learn about extension methods in Dart, which enable you to add new functionality to existing classes or enums without modifying their source code. This is particularly useful for adding custom methods to built-in types like strings, lists, or enums.

### Topics covered:

- Extension methods on classes
- Extension methods on enums
- Adding functionality to built-in types

## Lecture 6: Dynamic Types
In this lecture, we will delve into the dynamic type in Dart. A variable of type 'dynamic' can hold any value, and its type can be changed at runtime. This can be useful when you want a variable to hold different types of values, but it may also introduce potential risks and errors.

### Topics covered:

- Dynamic types and their usage
- Changing the type of a dynamic variable at runtime
- Type checking with the is and is! keywords

## Lecture 7: Operator Overloading and Custom toString
In this lecture, we will explore operator overloading and customizing the toString() method in Dart. Operator overloading allows you to redefine the behavior of built-in operators for your custom classes, while customizing the toString() method helps display meaningful information when printing instances of your class.

### Topics covered:

- Operator overloading
- Customizing the toString() method
- Manipulating instances of custom classes

## Lecture 8: Mixins
In this lecture, we will discuss mixins in Dart. Mixins are a way to reuse a class's code in multiple class hierarchies. They are useful when you want to share functionality between classes without using inheritance.

### Topics covered:

- Mixin declaration and usage
- Overriding mixin methods
- Combining mixins with classes

## Lecture 9: Cascades
In this lecture, we will explore the concept of cascades in Dart. Cascades allow you to perform a sequence of operations on the same object, making your code more concise and readable.

### Topics covered:

- Cascade syntax
- Chaining multiple operations on the same object
- Enhancing code readability with cascades

## Lecture 10: Singleton and Static Members
In this lecture, we will discuss singleton design patterns and static members in Dart. Singletons are used when you want to ensure that a class has only one instance, while static members can be accessed without creating an instance of the class.

### Topics covered:

- Static methods and variables
- Accessing static members without object instantiation
- Singleton design patterns

## Lecture 11: Factory Constructors
In this lecture, we will explore factory constructors in Dart. Factory constructors allow you to return an instance of a class, possibly from a cache or with modifications, instead of creating a new object every time a constructor is called.

### Topics covered:

- Factory constructor declaration and usage
- Overriding constructors with factory constructors
- Using factory constructors to create objects based on other objects

## Lecture 12: Eager and Lazy Singletons
In this lecture, we will discuss eager and lazy singletons in Dart. Singletons are used to ensure that a class has only one instance, and they can be implemented using eager or lazy initialization strategies.

### Topics covered:

- Eager singleton pattern
- Lazy singleton pattern
- Comparing eager and lazy singletons
- When to use each pattern

## Lecture 13: Enums, Getters, and Setters
In this lecture, we will discuss enums, getters, and setters in Dart. Enums are used to define a set of named constants, while getters and setters are used to encapsulate the fields of a class and control access to their values.

### Topics covered:

- Enum declaration and usage
- Getters and setters for class fields
- Filtering and querying lists with methods like any, where, and contains
- Using join to create a string from a list
